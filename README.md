# Signed-8-bit-Radix-4-Booth-Recoded-Array-Multiplier-in-VHDL
Design and Implement a signed 8-bit Radix-4 Booth Recoded Array Multiplier (All partial products are generated and added concurrently) using VHDL code. Do the structural coding using components for booth recoding. Partial products can be added using in-built operator + that would use Carry Propagate Adder resource within FPGA.
